: Blackjack is a card game where you play against the dealer.
: You receive all cards face up and the dealerâ€™s first card is face up and the second is face down.
: The object of the game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21.
: If a hand goes over 21, it is called a  "bust" or "break" and the wager is lost.
: In Blackjack, Jacks, Queens, Kings and 10s count as 10. An Ace may be played as a one or an 11.
: All other cards are played at face value.
