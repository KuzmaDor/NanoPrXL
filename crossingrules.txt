: You will be given two points from line A and B, and will have to calculate the intersection of the lines.
: To do that, you must first find the formulas of the lines.
: 
: The basic formula of a line is: y=ax+b .
: Knowing the points P(X1, Y1) and Q(X2, Y2) that lay on the line, you can find the value of 'a'
: from the basic formula, by solving this: a = (Y2-Y1)/(X2-X1) .
: Knowing 'a' you can find the entire line by inserting the values of X and Y
: from one of the points into the X and Y slots on the basic formula, which will turn your basic formula
: from y=ax+b to (knownY)=(knownA)*(knownX)+b, and from then you can easily find b.
: 
: Do that for both lines, and then to find their intersection point
: just make an equation out of both lines, e.g. ax+b = ax+b, but with known lines instead of basic formulas.
: Solve the equation to find the X, and to find Y, insert the X into one of the two lines and solve

: I know it's a lot, but the game is made to keep your mind sharp. Now go be a math wizard, i believe in you
